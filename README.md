# Future Functions

We plan to further enhance `quill-better-table-plus` by adding the following features in a future release:

- [ ] **Adapts to multiple `table` formats**: Supports a wide range of directly copied and pasted `table` data with
  styles and better parsing and rendering.
- [ ] **Expose more `api`**: Provide more `api` for developers to use in order to quickly apply different features,
  looks and styles.
- [ ] **`Typescript` support**

We are working hard on these features and will gradually roll them out in future releases. Stay tuned!

If you have any other feature suggestions or ideas, feel free to raise them in the issue, we'd love to hear your
feedback and contributions.
